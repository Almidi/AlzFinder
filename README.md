Project Overview :

A common disease of the mind that occurs on many elder people is the Alzheimer’s disease. It is the cause of 60% to 70% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events (short-term memory loss). As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, not managing self-care, and behavioral issues. 
Our project’s main objective was to provide a method for locating easily lost relatives, who suffering from this disease choose to wonder outside of their home premises without informing their close ones. This has lead us to the development of a GPS tracking device capable of informing the user about the patient’s position using the GSM standard as a means of communication.
The project is also expected to function for a reasonable amount of time since it is a device for emergency situations. This also enables the device to stay on-line for grater time periods which increases the odds of full GPS and GSM coverage.
